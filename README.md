## 📌 Achievements & Projects

### 🧭 Project Leadership

Led the creation of a university web platform that allowed lab reservations without physical presence. Defined user roles, structured agile sprints, and deployed a functional interface without a connected database. This improved administrative efficiency and streamlined internal processes.

Directed the design and strategic plan for a tech-based startup developing smart RFID-enabled locks. The project included internal documentation, business modeling, and full feasibility analysis, earning recognition in a local entrepreneurship showcase.

Guided a cross-functional team in developing a smart access control system in an academic innovation course. Aligned technical development with strategic goals, delivering a well-documented and functional prototype.

---

### 🧮 Project Estimation

Accurately estimated development time for a web-based academic system using COCOMO and Use Case Points. This ensured realistic sprint planning and contributed to successful project completion.

Conducted a 5-year demand forecast for a smart lock product using Function Points and CPI, validating the business proposal’s viability and aligning it with market trends.

Estimated scope and effort for a student tracking app in a classroom setting, applying Function Points to improve planning accuracy and reduce resource misuse.

---

### 🧪 Prototype Development

Developed interactive Figma prototypes for an RFID control system with separate flows for admins and users, earning praise for usability and visual coherence.

Designed 3D models of university technical labs using SketchUp and Blender, which were integrated into presentations and simulated physical environments prior to implementation.

Built a logical prototype of a student record management system that simulated login, data entry, and access control. This allowed process validation before code deployment.
